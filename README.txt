Coast.  To install it, copy Eberron.js and Eberrondoc.html into your Scribe
installation directory and add 'Eberron.js' to the CUSTOMIZATION_URLS array in
your installation's scribe.html.  If you also want to use the Eberron prestige
classes, copy EberronPrestige.js into your Scribe installation directory and
add 'EberronPrestige.js' to the CUSTOMIZATION_URLS array.
