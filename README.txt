This package contains a plug-in that allows the Scribe Character Editor to
work with characters from the Eberron campaign setting from Wizards of the
Coast.  To install it, copy Eberron.js into your Scribe installation directory,
then add 'Eberron.js' to the CUSTOMIZATION_URLS array in your installation's
scribe.html.  If you also want to use the Eberron prestige classes, copy
EberronPrestige.js into your Scribe installation directory and add
'EberronPrestige.js' to the CUSTOMIZATION_URLS array.
